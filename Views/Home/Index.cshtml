<h1>About</h1>
<p class="paragraph">I am a software developer who works at <a href="https://contessahealth.com/">Contessa Health</a> in Nashville, TN and lives in nearby Franklin. I moved here at the end
    of 2017 after spending most of my earlier life in Georgia. My family consists of my wife, two children and
    a black cat named Yinz. I have been fascinated by programming since I took a C++ class as an elective in college,
    but I have lots of other interests including listening to and playing music (mostly bass), reading,
    running and watching sports. I've dabbled in brewing beer and cycling (not at the same time). My favorite book is
    probably either Lord of the Rings or Catch-22. My favorite band is Rush but I listen to lots of different music; I
    won't say "all kinds" because that's a lazy answer but I'm a fan of artists ranging from Lana Del Rey to Future Sound
    of London to King Crimson to The Specials. I attend the Cool Springs location of <a href="https://www.christpres.org/">Christ Presbyterian Church</a>. This
    website is all hand-written html and css because most of the web has gone in a dumb direction and I was inspired by
    things like <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">this</a> to go about it differently.
